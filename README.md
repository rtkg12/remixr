#remixr-A smart playlist generator for Spotify  
  
### Features - Spotify login
- Generate playlists based on artists, tracks or seed playlists 
- Generate playlists based on personal playlists as a seed  
- Tune parameters like **popularity**, **mood**, **energy**, etc. to further customize the playlist  

## Algorithm to generate similar playlists

 - Feature range calculation
	 1. Get all the tracks in a playlist from the Spotify API
	 2. Query Spotify for different track features
	 3. Calculate the 0.1 and 0.9 quantile range for each feature
	 4. Use these as min and max targets for each feature
- Extract most relevant artists and tracks as seeds
	1. Find the frequency of artists and tracks in:
		- Playlist
		- User profile / listening history: short, medium, long term
	2. Select most frequently appearing artists and tracks that exist in the playlist
- Query Spotify API with the calculated seeds and parameter values
  
## Installation  
  
### Clone  
  
	 git clone https://github.com/rtkg12/remixr.git  

### Pre-requisites  
  
1. Make a developer account at https://developer.spotify.com and obtain the `Client ID` and `Client Secret`  
2. Update `client/.env` and `server/app.env` accordingly.

|Property| Description  |
|--|--|
| REACT_APP_API_URL | Use `/api` for default configuration. Replace with backend server address for custom deployment |
|REACT_APP_TRACKING_ID|`optional` Google Analytics Tracking Id |
|CLIENT_URL|Address of the client application|
|REDIRECT_URI|Callback endpoint for Spotify authentication. `Note` Make sure this matches the Redirect URL in the Spotify API console|

### Installation

	yarn install

### Building and developing locally

#### Configuration
 
 |Environment variable| Value  |
|--|--|
| REACT_APP_API_URL | `http://localhost:8080/api` |
|CLIENT_URL|`http://localhost:3000`|
|REDIRECT_URI|`http://localhost:8080/api/callback`|

#### Running the project	
	yarn develop

The React app should start running in port `3000` and the Node.js app will be running in `8080`

### Deploying to Production

#### Configuration
 
 |Environment variable| Value  |
|--|--|
| REACT_APP_API_URL | `/api` |
|CLIENT_URL|`http://PUBLIC_URL`|
|REDIRECT_URI|`http://PUBLIC_URL/api/callback`|

#### Deploying
	yarn deploy

This will build the React app and serve the build folder from Express. Express should be running in port `8080`

## Future Areas of Improvement

- Add support for greater than five seeds using random sampling from generated playlists
- Functionality to add individual songs to library directly from the app
- Regenerate, re-order and edit the playlist dynamically before saving
- Session-wide playlist building. Add songs from multiple queries, save in the end
- Algorithm improvements - different statistical measures, collaborative filtering
